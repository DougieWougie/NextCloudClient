  Backup rules for Android 11 and below (API 30 and below)

  These rules work in conjunction with android:allowBackup="false" in the manifest
  to ensure no sensitive data is backed up on older Android versions.

  Even though allowBackup is false, we explicitly define these rules as defense-in-depth.
